# Auditor

The auditor is a command-line tool for doing sanity checks on individual files and batches of files. It checks that the files are in the proper locations in preservation strorage, and that file sizes and S3 metadata are correct.

This tool can check dozens of files per minute. For usage info, see the [README](https://github.com/APTrust/preservation-services/tree/master/audit){target=_blank}.
